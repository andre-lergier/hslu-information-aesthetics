Water-related ecosystems have always provided natural sites for human settlements, along with a wealth of ecosystem services. Yet, like other natural resources, water is under threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s. An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland area has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation, billions of people—mostly in rural areas—still lack these basic services.</p></div></section><section class="infographic"><section class="container"><h2>Worldwide Development</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-50"><p>The data set contains percentage values of how many people have access to safe and affordable drinking water in different countires, regions and continents.

Even inside those geographical areas there are huge differences.<br>To get an overview over the worldwide situation, the following diagram is reduced to <b>continents</b> or continental areas. The zero-line visualizes the world index of the selected year. In continents above the base line people have better access to drinking water than the average of the world. Continents below the line do have worse conditions than the world average.</p></section><section class="container-wide differenceChartWrapper"><div class="horizontal-scroll-container"><div class="chart-wrapper horizontal-scroll-wrapper"><section class="chart" id="differenceChart"></section></div></div><div class="controls"><button class="controlButton button" data-column="initial">2000</button> <button class="controlButton button active" data-column="latest">2017</button><div class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" checked="checked" id="toggleLabels" class="custom-control-input"> <label class="custom-control-label" for="toggleLabels">Labels</label></div></div></section></section></main><footer class="gray-bg"><section class="container"><p class="project-info">This is a project I did in the course Studio Information Aesthetics & Engineering Extended in my Digital Ideation studies at Lucerne University of Applied Science and Arts HSLU.<br>In the beginning it was important to analyse the dataset to get some interesting findings.
