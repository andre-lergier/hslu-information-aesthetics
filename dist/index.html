Water-related ecosystems have always provided natural sites for human settlements, along with a wealth of ecosystem services. Yet, like other natural resources, water is under threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s. An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland area has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation, billions of people—mostly in rural areas—still lack these basic services.</p></div></section><section class="infographic"><section class="container"><h2>Infographic</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-50"><p>The information from the data source contain a percentage value of how many people have access to safe and affordable drinking water in different countires, regions and continents.
