Water-related ecosystems have always provided natural sites for human settlements, along with a wealth of ecosystem services. Yet, like other natural resources, water is under threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the worldâ€™s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s. An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the worldâ€™s natural wetland area has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation, billions of peopleâ€”mostly in rural areasâ€”still lack these basic services.</p></div></section><section class="container"><div class="horizontal-scroll-container"><div class="chart-wrapper horizontal-scroll-wrapper"><section class="chart"></section></div></div></section></main><script type="text/javascript" src="/js/main.js?5d7f595d68ac807256c9"></script></body></html>
