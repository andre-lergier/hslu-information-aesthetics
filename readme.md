# Infographic about UN Sustainable Goal 6
This is a project I did in the course __Studio Information Aesthetics & Engineering Extended__ in my Digital Ideation studies at Lucerne University of Applied Science and Arts HSLU.

> __Goal 6 Clean Water and Sanitation__:
> Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
>
> __Target 6.1 Universal Access__:
> By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.
>
> __Indicator 6.1.1__:
> Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services.

## Process
The first thing I did are data analysis. It's quite a big dataset so I had the challenge to find some interesting facts in it.<br>
With help from Microsoft Excel I could rearrange the document. With filters and sorting I could find my first interesting learnings:
- The access to safe drinking water in Singapore is 14 times higher than in Uganda
- 16% of people in North Macedonia lost access to safe and affordable drinking water between 2010 and 2017. In the same time, the access increased in Armenia by 57%
- Access to drinking water for European people is almost 4 times higher than people in Western Africa.

### Getting ideas
Surprised by this facts I started to create a mindmap. I tried to find out, what could be interesting to show.

### Sketches
Based on the mindmap I created some sketches of simple data diagrams. The dimensions I tried to show are the development over time, the percentage value of people with access to drinking water, some geographical informations like country, continent or just 'world', as well as the location (allarea, urban, rural).
Unfortunately the location data is missing in many geo areas.

I tried to make some sketches to show the difference all over the world as well. I was surprised by the high numbers of people, not having access to drinking water. Because of that, I tried to give this information a higher visibility and turned around the diagram (left).<br>
To focus on the topic of drinking water, I tried to showcase the relation between continents with some glasses of water.

An interesting fact I found as well is the difference in development between rural and urban areas in different countries.

In my next step I had to dive in the dataset again, select the interesting facts of my sketches and bring all this together.

### Finding
As drawn in my last sketch, I had the idea to compare the values of continents/global regions with the values from the world. In this case, the value from the world is the reference on the x-axis.

Following this idea I moved on creating sketches. I tried to illustrate the "iceberg principle" with a base line, values above and values underneath it.

Based on Sketch number 3 I created a detailled version
